## Examples

Within this directory, you can find a number of different partial examples which
show how to use Ponzu and its features. The goal of this directory is not to host 
full Ponzu projects, but rather just a few files or a package to demonstrate interface 
implementation, using hooks, adding new API endpoints, or creating/using addons.

For full-project examples, please see the [`ponzu-cms/examples`](https://github.com/ponzu-cms/examples) repo.

If you are making a contribution to the Ponzu project and are introducing a new
feature, it would be very helpful to include an example with a concrete use-case 
for this directory.
